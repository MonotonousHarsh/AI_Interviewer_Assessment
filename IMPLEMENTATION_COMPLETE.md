## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

### Component Architecture
```
ServiceCompanyFlow (Orchestrator)
├── manages round progression
├── tracks overall progress
├── handles round completion
└── displays completion screen

Each Round Component
├── fetches questions/problems from API
├── manages local state (answers, time)
├── handles submission
├── displays results
└── triggers onComplete callback
```

### State Flow
```
App.jsx
  ↓ (creates assessment)
ServiceCompanyFlow
  ↓ (passes assessmentId)
Round Components
  ↓ (call APIs with assessmentId)
Backend
  ↓ (returns results)
Round Components
  ↓ (trigger onComplete)
ServiceCompanyFlow
  ↓ (moves to next round)
```

### API Pattern
```javascript
// Each round follows this pattern:
1. Start round: POST /service/assessments/{id}/{round}/start
2. Get content: GET /service/assessments/{round}/{roundId}/...
3. Submit: POST /service/assessments/{round}/{roundId}/submit
4. Get results: GET /service/assessments/{round}/{roundId}/results
```
